NAME
    App::ThinPacker - enable your scripts to autoinstall their dependencies

DESCRIPTION
    Enables your scripts to autoinstall their dependencies by injecting a
    small piece of code which downloads cpanminus and uses it to install all
    the depenencies.

SYNOPSIS
        thinpack your-script.pl > your-script-dist.pl

        thinpack your-script.pl --sudo > your-script.pl

  NOTE ABOUT CPANM

    You can specify custom arguments after your script filename. Those
    arguments will be passed to all `cpanm' calls.

    This way you can enable interactive installation (`--interactive'),
    disable testing (`--no-test'), require root privelegies (`--sudo'), and
    do other useful things. For more options see App::cpanminus.

    Rudimentary parsing
    Downloading cpanm from third-party source
